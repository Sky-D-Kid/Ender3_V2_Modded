# Klipper Configurations

In this directory I saved vanilla, modified and self made Klipper configs. 

## Printer configs changes

### ender3_modded.cfg
- Changed hotend max temp to 280, because I upgraded to a 300° C thermomister and better temperature sensor
- Included mainsail.cfg, because vanilla version was missing it and Klipper won't work without it
- Included custom created sensors.cfg, to keep the printer.cfg tidy and uncluttered
- Added exclude objects, don't forget to change it in mainsail.cfg too!

### standard

## Extra configs

### sensors.cfg
- A config file to declare all sensors one can use
